# Error: React.Children.only expected to receive a single React element child.

Fix:


# Type error: Property 'className' does not exist on type 'AlertDialogPortalProps'.

@radix-ui/react-dialog on version v1.0.5

If you remove the ^ from your package.json, delete your lock file, run install again and stick with v1.0.4 for now the problem is solved.
